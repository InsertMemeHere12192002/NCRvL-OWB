  EHT_ride_true_desc:0 "In the dust-settled aftermath of conquest, the Eighties stand unchallenged, masters of Utah's expanse. Like phantoms of steel and diesel, their war wagons roar across the highways, a testament to their indomitable will. Each road, each twisted scrap of metal, sings of their triumph. No longer mere marauders, they are the sovereigns of speed, the lords of the asphalt seas. In this post-war world, they are the architects of their fate, shaping destiny with each thunderous mile conquered. Their legacy is written in tire tracks and echoes in the roar of engines, a fierce hymn to survival and power."

  EHT_cult_of_nas_desc:0 "Two Sun's Cult of Nas is similar to our own beliefs. Although we do not worship the highway as such, and they are somewhat soft, they understand the Great Journey. Perhaps we can ride the Highway together? And most compelling, their priests have brought gifts."

  EHT_ally_mormons:0 "Subjugating the Canaanites"
  EHT_ally_mormons_desc:0 "Now that Thunderbird has taken some of our best warriors, we are left in a bind. Fortunately, New Canaan, a city ripe with wealth yet militarily feeble, presents an opportunity. Instead of direct hostility, we will guise our control as an alliance. Subtly leading them against the White Legs and driving them into our arms. Over time, we can earn their trust, then prey on it for our own gain."
  EHT_propose_mormon_alliance:0 "Feigned Alliance"
  EHT_propose_mormon_alliance_desc:0 "By feigning interest in their safety, we can manipulate the Canaanites into a so-called alliance. Their naivety regarding our intentions allows us to exploit their wealth and strategic position, all while planning their eventual subjugation."
  EHT_old_ferry:0 "Prelude to Control"
  EHT_old_ferry_desc:0 "The Western Dockyard, under our influence, becomes a crucial node in controlling New Canaan's trade. This move not only boosts our coffers but also tightens our grip on the Canaanites' economy."
  EHT_eastern_dockyard:0 "Exploit Western Trade"
  EHT_eastern_dockyard_desc:0 "With the Western Dockyard operational and under our sway, we exploit its capabilities for our benefit. It's a strategic leap towards the economic subjugation of New Canaan, disguised as mutual progress."
  EHT_western_dockyard:0 "Eastern Trade Domination"
  EHT_western_dockyard_desc:0 "What the Canaanites see as an alliance is but a prelude to their subjugation. As they grow increasingly dependent on us for trade and security, we weave our influence deeper, setting the stage for complete control over their wealth and assets."
  EHT_join_mormon_alliance:0 "Treaty of the Lake"
  EHT_join_mormon_alliance_desc:0 "The Treaty of the Lake, while outwardly a pact of mutual benefit, is heavily skewed in our favor. New Canaan, under the guise of protection, offers us significant trade advantages and concessions. Their desperation for security has led them to a deal that greatly empowers us, at minimal cost. It's a cunning victory for the Eighties, exploiting New Canaan's vulnerabilities while masking our true intentions of eventual domination."
  EHT_utah_war_delay_trigger_tt:0 "If we try to ally §Y[WHT.GetNameWithFlag]§! or §Y[NCN.GetNameWithFlag]§!, they need to either accept and enter into an alliance with us, or they must reject us."
