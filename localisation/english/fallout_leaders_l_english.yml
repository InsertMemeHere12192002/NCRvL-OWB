  ACH_KATHRINE_TORNI_NAME:0 "Kathrine Ffion Törni"
  ACH_KATHRINE_TORNI_DESC:0 "§t"Sometimes I do wonder: what would Maxson have done?"§!\n\nKathrine Ffion Törni is a skilled sniper, infiltrator, and organizer. Her involvement with the Texan Brotherhood had quite a rough start, her mother being a high-ranking Lost Hills elder, Kathrine was sent to Texas shortly after birth in an attempt to keep her safe from the encroaching NCR.\n\nIn Texas, she made herself a reputation quickly. An adventuring youth, her exploits in Fort Hood alongside Rosado made her well-known and respected. These adventures were always done in line with the Brotherhood of Steel Codex, as her mother always spoke of its importance. Yet, her studies of the Codex only made it more apparent how far the Texan BoS had strayed from the Brotherhood's principles.\n\nAs an adult she joined the Circle of Steel, a secret police, designated to upkeep loyalty to Lost Hills. Still, there were just too many dissidents and traitors for a small group to deal with. A new plan was needed: splinter. They would gather all still loyal forces and form a new chapter, committed to upholding the Codex at all costs.\n\nIt seems, her plan was successful. But can the new chapter survive? With few in number and enemies on all sides, history seems doomed to repeat itself and the Alamo may fall again..."

The spectre of this dark event has hung over her tenure as Empress ever since, and her subsequent defeat at the hands of the Itza have only strengthened murmuring that she may be unworthy.  Despite all of this, the blind Empress knows that she can not afford to abandon the weight of leadership, for a terrible dream has haunted her for the last ten years.

  ATE_KINKAID_NAME:0 "Gail Kinkaid"
  ATE_KINKAID_DESC:0 "The navy of the Aztlan Empire is considered to be a farce in the eyes of most people, due in no small part to its inability to win a single battle against the Itza in extensive history. However, Gale Kinkaid, the descendant of a man forcibly pulled from one of America's secretive bunkers, believes wholesale in the ability of the Aztlan to eventually defeat the Itza. His belief stems in no small part from his family's long naval history, which stretches back to the Second World War. Kinkaid has spent decades pushing for expensive naval reforms, much to the annoyance of his counterparts in the Army."

Quite probably that's the reason why he volunteered to lead the expedition to the Boulder Dome as well: at least that way he'd get to stay in one place and do research of his own.\n\nThe mishaps, troubles and accidents that befell the Dome mission have just made him more cynical, bitter and altogether, more of a workaholic than ever before - and it's quite easy to blame Victor Presper for all of this.

It is a title as gruesome as the one who carries it, a ghoul whose trail of carnage has become enshrined as cartel legend. Nobody knows when he was born, but the ghoul who would go on to become “The Bloody Bandit” had long been a malicious, calculating individual. Arriving from the East with a band of highly-trained killers, the Bandido soon found employment in the crumbling remains of the southern Sinaloa cartel, stemming the luchadore advance with a mixture of tactical brillance and exceptional cruelty. Now as the undisputed ruler of Southern Sinaloa, the Bandido's ambitions have only grown, when the time comes, the blood of Mexico will flow like rivers once more."

Raul Moya of the Viceroyalty and his extended family were exiled across the Sea of Cortés to Baja California. Raul died soon after due to infection, leaving his family in the care of his son Guarez. The towns of the southern Baja began to form faux-cities, fueled by the same corruption that sent the Moya family west.\n\nDespite owning a vacation retreat in the Boneyard, Guarez's empire lacked one thing, reach. It was here Villa and Guarez shook hands to unite the gangs of the peninsula under the dual rule of the §HValle§! and §GPaz§! factions, forming a funnel of contraband into the NCR. Guns, liquor, chems, and even people are brought into the north, with precious metals in return. California bleeds its riches for a taste of the outside wasteland, keeping the wheel of corruption spinning.\n\nNow Guarez's home in the Boneyard is a drug rehabilitation center under §MAllgood's§! anti-crime initiative, and §RKimball's§! rhetoric has formed a palpable layer of tension. With politicians snarling southward, it's up to Guarez to maintain his lucrative status-quo, less his family lose their home again."

After being captured by the Blackfoot, he witnessed the foundations of the Caesar's Legion, and the suffering it brought to anything it touched. Civilization, progress, humanity. All trampled under the Legion's banner. As someone believed in ahimsa, non-violence at all costs, he opposed Sallow as much as he could. After all his disagreements with 'Caesar', he returned to Boneyard to inform everyone about the grim news.\n\n Returning home as a changed man, he became more and more involved in teaching the common man in California. He spent his days teaching communities how to grow their own crops, hurting the monopoly of the Brahmin Barons, drawing their ire. Despite all the harassment from the Barons, he continued to travel town to town, teaching everything he knew to improve the lives of countless people across all the wasteland. This act of selflessness earned him many followers who preached his ideals to the wasteland, elevating him to the status of a public figure against the corruption and ever-growing militarization.\n\n Growing wearier every day, seeing the Republic plunge into chaos after the coup was the last straw for him. He called a protest, and when he called, the Republic answered. Thousands of small folk rose up for the man who helped them in their time of need. With a stimpak on one hand and a rifle on the other, Calhoun represents the ordinary man and the Californian Way.\n"

Whilst a Mormon sympathiser, Rachel is no Mormon herself, and so in the power vacuum created by the collapse of Mormon power in the north she took her opperturnity to gather an alliance of comapnies and declared independence.

All of the proceeds from smuggling have gone to improve the living standards of the Valle's residents, causing him to enjoy great support from his people. In recent years, however, the NCR has been increasingly aggressive, sending settlers to displace his people. The resulting violence and its aftermath has raised tensions even higher, and Pancho prepares for a conflict in the near future.

  COW_BILLY_CLANTON_DESC:0 "A deserter from the Arizona Rangers many decades before the Battle of Kingman, Billy found himself in an odd position when the last splinters of the Arizona Rangers came fleeing south. Over the decades since his desertion, Billy slowly gained power through advocating for isolationism: in the face of the Bull, it seemed like an honest goal. His old sympathies still hung around him, however: how could Clanton turn away the remnants of the Rangers, as broken as they were? After many sleepless nights he reached a compromise with himself, agreeing to let the Rangers settle down in the Cowboy Country if they agreed not to militarise. After all, Clanton couldn't risk Caesar's wrath. Caesar will come for them eventually, but maybe – just maybe – not today."

So watch your back, because if you mess with the Dryblowers, you'll have Lynch to answer to, and trust me, he really likes showing what his last name *really* means."§! - J.H. 'MFer' Christ\n\nJohn Lynch, a seasoned leader of the community known as the Dryblowers, emerged as a pivotal figure after a rebellion unfolded in the depths of Burham Springs and the Burning Mines. With a diverse group of former tribals, ex-slaves, and raiders at his side, John spearheaded their flight north, away from the clutches of the Daughters of Hecate, determined to forge their own path in the unforgiving wasteland. Although they began to settle into their newfound freedom, tensions simmered on the horizon.\n\nThe Dryblowers found themselves embroiled in a fierce war against Ouroboros, vying for control of the land taken away from their Dark Mother. John and his followers displayed their mettle, ultimately prevailing over their adversaries and liberating the slaves and tribals who suffered under Ouroboros' reign, and earning Lynch the nickname of "Lucan", in reference to his clever manipulation of canines, taught to him by one Jordan Dae.\n\nDespite this, the triumphant victory was only the beginning of a complex web of interactions. John Lynch, now known to friends and enemies as "Caveman", for his perceived backward viewpoints and situational approaches, now 51 years old, had steered the settlement towards prosperity since 2260, but his autocratic rule had garnered opposition from those like Marianne Sharp. Marianne advocated for direct democracy, actively working to undermine Lynch's authority and push for a different form of governance within the community. As defense remains a focal point for John, the internal tensions within the Dryblowers threaten to overshadow their successes and pose new challenges to their survival. A challenge the Dark Mother looks to act upon soon..."

  INR_ALKAYA_DESC: "§g"Our path, our past- it’s here somewhere... somewhere in this canyon, hidden by the junk, stolen by the slavers... It’s waiting for us."§!\n\nOnce a part of a larger tribe, far west of Colorado, the Iron Lines were exiled for unknown reasons, transforming into a nomadic tribe, following and charting out the old-world’s railroad system, worshipping the trains that travelled it as a prophecy that the old world would return, allowing them to escape the enslavement that many other tribes faced at the hands of the Legion and Hecate for many years. This nomadic way of life led to their discovery of a largely abandoned rail station; the Iron Lines established a base of operation in this station to follow and eventually command the trains- naming it Circle Junction as an ode to their brethren out west. This junction quickly blossomed into a bustling trade hub, guiding trains from west to east, north to south, and incurred the attention of forces that would exploit this up-and-coming tribe.\n\nReferred to as the Iron Lines by those in Colorado in reference to the parallel lines painting the tribe’s bodies, the tribe themselves have forgotten what the tattoos depicted. As Circle Junction became a place for trade, slavers and raiders pilfered the naive tribe’s defenceless settlement, leaving only the weak and young, once again causing the homeless tribe to lose their identity once again...\n\nAlkaya was amongst those left behind orphaned at a young age; she escaped the surrounding chaos by playing in the abandoned train cars, giving her many places to hide in the often occurring raids, and allowed her to save the growing population of orphans in the Iron Lines from the slavers until one day they stopped coming. Now in her adulthood, she wishes to forge a stronger fleet, one in which the lines that paint their bodies may paint their canyon, and allow them to find their new path and identity, never to be stolen again..."

There, he rapidly rose through the ranks of the Ejército, the regulars of the Itza, partaking in a large amount of Chichen Itza's early campaigns beyond the Yucatán peninsula. His defining moment, however, was at the Battle of the Papaloapan River, where he rallied the routing Itzan forces to him following the death of their commanding officer. Under Sebastián's orders, the army would reorganize and counter-attack, fending off the Aztlán, and crowning him a hero.

Whilst she missed out on the best higher education, in part thanks to her parent's lack of contacts, she maintained her desire to join the administrative branch of the Chichen Itzan Empire. Her silver tongue and quick wit earned her rapid promotions through the ranks of the Cancún administration, and many girls to boot, before she became the protégé of the Kalomte Sebastián II himself when he witnessed her efficiency first-hand during a visit to Cancún.

  KHA_UNGERN_STERNBERG_DESC: "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', and officially referred to by his noble title, Darkhan Khoshoi Chin Wang in the degree of Khan, had a troubled upbringing, constantly moving and with a father who was committed to an insane asylum. His family estate in Estonia was burned down in 1905, which confirmed his anti-peasant and eventual anti-communist beliefs. He eventually joined Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg, where he became interested in the occult and Buddhism. After graduation he was transferred to Siberia, where he became known for his heavy drinking and dangerous moods. In 1913, he moved to Khovd in Outer Mongolia as an officer in the detachment at the Russian consulate, after not being allowed to fight for Mongolian independence.\n\nIn the First Weltkrieg, Ungern fought first in Galicia then, after a two month prison stint following an episode where he attacked another officer in a drunken rage, he would serve once more in the Caucasus. After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, he fought with Semyonov and the Whites in Siberia, acting relatively independently in his personal crusade against the communists.\n\nUngern eventually travelled through China where he married Manchu Princess Elena Pavlovna, or ‘Ji’. Eventually, he moved to Urga, and defeated the Chinese garrison stationed there, restoring the Bogd Khan to the throne and proclaiming Mongolia independent.\n\nUngern himself did not get too involved in Mongol problems, but he kept the peace through force. After narrowly defeating a socialist revolution in 1921 and 1924, he was forced to get more involved. His forces prowled the streets as he hunted out dissidents and purged Mongolian society, including in temples. Though close friends and having similar ideas as the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, Ungern’s ambition knows no bounds. With Ungern’s grip dependent on his Russian military clique, there are fears he will continue to siphon power from the Bogd Khan for himself.\n\nThese fears were made manifest when Ungern was wounded in a battle with the Gada Meiren, falling into a brief coma and recovered prophetic, hallucinatory visions of Buddhist deities and ethereal spirits. Upon his reawakening, the Mad Baron was dead, and a new Khan rose to take his place. Maddened beyond comparison, Ungern now believes himself to be the reincarnation of Genghis Khan and the avatar of Mahakala, the Buddhist God of Death. Now, this great Khan seeks to restore the great Mongolian Empire old."

Whilst he never dared challenge the word of the Living Prophet, Jeremiah, Daniel was never afraid to speak up for the downtrodden and protect those in need. Sensing the danger Daniel may have posed to his rule, Jeremiah often sent Daniel on long, disorganised missionary campaigns throughout the past two decades. Whilst effective at limiting Daniel's pushback against growing decadence, Daniels work with the tribes of Utah provided him with a deep understanding of their customs and ways of life, and made him many friends amongst the tribes. During the crisis of the White Legs offensives, Daniel returned home, and quickly became a leader-figure of those who thought the Canaanites had lost their way. Characterised by his kind eyes and warm words, Daniel leads his flock with tender care."

  NCN_JOSHUA_GRAHAM_DESC:0 "Originally a missionary of God, Graham's life was transformed in 2246 when he met two Followers of the Apocalypse in the caves and crags of the Grand Canyon. These two Followers, Bill Calhoun and Edward Sallow, were studying local tribal dialects; a field Graham was an expert in. Deciding to help their research, Graham became their translator, helping the research team move between tribes. In 2247, the group visited the Blackfoot tribe, and disaster struck. The group was prevented from leaving out of desperation on the Blackfoot's part: they were losing multiple wars. Refusing to be erradicated alongside the Blackfoot, Sallow taught the tribe everything he knew about warfare, and assisted them in annihilating their foes. Graham remained with Sallow, now dubbed 'Caesar', firstly as a translator, then general, and finally Caesar's Malpais Legate. Graham proved a brutal leader, committing horrendous atrocities in the name of the Caesar, and was Caesar's most trusted general: trusted so much he was tasked with leading the Legion's armies in the West. Graham's terrible deeds began to catch up with him, even as he ran to avoid them. Slowly but surely, his conscious was being eaten away, and the word of the Lord returned to him as a comfort. This the Caesar could not stand, for Caesar himself was the only 'God' tolerable in the Legion, but the Caesar was willing to put up with this as long as Graham's victories kept coming in. And so Joshua became the Burned Man. Eerywhere he goes, Joshua Graham commands respect: his eyes burn with hatred for the Legion as brightly as the pitch that he burnt in on the Caesar's orders."
  JoshuaReturnsCanaanBurns:0 "That is, until Graham dared speak out against the Caesar's support for the razing of New Canaan. It was clear to Caesar then that Graham's loyalties lay elsewhere, and so Caesar ordered him publicly executed."

In the eyes of voters, he has become not the strong man, such as Kimball, or the compassionate man, such as Allgood, but the smart man, one pushing us into the future- utilizing the past to accomplish this and rallying members of the Californian military to join him in this effort.\n\nCitizens and inhabitants of the wasteland alike prepare for the change he's promised to come, and the realization of the future that twinkles in Hayes’ eyes."

The stunning performance propelled the already successful seat-holding Boneyard politician into the national spotlight, gaining respect for his bold, incisive critique and netting his famous nickname of Allgood.\n\nIn the years following, he cemented himself as an enemy of the traditional Warhawks and Plutocrats of the NCR political scene, one not easily disposed of. After delivering his deciding speech, Allgood was granted the presidency, becoming an even more imposing problem for the corruption of the NCR, promising reintegration programs and peace.\n\nWith ties to the Followers and the Brotherhood, Allgood reflects the best of the NCR - a melting pot of the idealists who strove for a better life.  The NCR is now led by a man who is as ruthless towards his foes as he is compassionate for the vanquished - for does not true victory come from making friends of foes?  Although many of his critics lambast him as a pacifist, this could not be further from the truth.

When the makeshift idyll of Broken Hills began to unravel with the depletion of its precious uranium cornerstone and its mutant citizens migrated to Reno, Thradd became an idol among the mutant community as a model of stability and security for mutantkind. With the collapse of the fragile harmony between man and mutant in Reno, Thradd now serves as the de-facto leader in the otherwise anarchic streets of Reno.

But for the Ciphers as a whole, he knows that spiritualism and memorizing ancient schema will only help so much. For the tribe to survive in this rapidly changing new world, it must understand that, contrary to Counter Azkee's propositions of utilizing technology for all its worth, the only way forward that won't result in the tribe losing its place in the world is to retain the status it had when the Prisoner first visited.\n\nBut even as the Nemonik discourages technology, he recognizes the help it provided to many within the Ciphers. Were it not for Trig and her idea of a laser cannon, the Vipers may have turned Mesa Verde into another Dark Mother slave pen. If it weren't for the assistance of the Maxson Bunker Brotherhood, the Ciphers would not have survived the harsh famine that resulted from Denom's 'miracle fertilizer' mishap.

Born amidst the chaotic landscape of the wasteland, Face-Masher has become a master of deception and psychological warfare, partly out of necessity, and partly out of the sheer thrill. While the Riperult have gained a notorious reputation as cannibals, it is all part of an elaborate ruse to protect their land and maintain control over the towns under their watchful eye.\n\nOriginally known as Rult's Raiders, the group transformed into Rip-Rult, and later Riperult, after eliminating their former leader. Though Face-Masher allegedly claimed his name through the literal mashing of Rult's face, in reality, Rult was simply knocked out and imprisoned, with the resulting isolation causing Rult to slowly scar his own face until it resembled mashed potatoes. This symbolic act also caused Masher to earn his name, as he was the one to come across Rult and his grisly demise. Shedding their old identity in the heat of the moment and embracing a more fearsome image, Face-Masher, with his cunning intellect and commanding presence, stepped into the role of leader and became the face of their intimidating facade.\n\nUnder Face-Masher's guidance, the Riperult adopted an elaborate charade. By cultivating a reputation as cannibals, rapists, baby-eaters, and worse, they instil fear in those who might otherwise challenge their authority. The towns under their protection are obligated to play along with this facade, resulting in wilder and crazier stories of impossible acts of savagery, further solidifying the Raiders' control and reinforcing the notion that they are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nBut in reality, behind the terrifying exterior of falsehoods, lies a group of individuals who are simply trying to survive and protect their territory. Face-Masher, with his strategic mind and faux-fierce leadership, orchestrates a delicate balance between maintaining the illusion of brutality and ensuring the safety and prosperity of his people. Few truly know the true nature of the Riperult Raiders, and Face-Masher's enigmatic persona only adds to the air of mystery surrounding this formidable group.

At sixteen, Rosado packed her bags and left for one of the T.A.A.'s few robotics factories, working the assembly-line as an apprentice to lesser men. By twenty three she'd had enough of the restrictions placed upon her work, and travelled beyond the Republic's borders. There, she encountered the Brotherhood of Steel; bartering her genius for knowledge. Valentina aided the Texan Chapter in everything from recovering data, to fixing robots, to breaking into bunkers. She lost her arm to get the Brotherhood inside Fort Hood, and for her sacrifice they saved her life. With the backing of Texas strongest few, a new arm, and unmatched mechanical genius: Rosado intends to change the Republic forever."

The spiritual power of the Shaman-Kings is tied to the unique peculiarities of the Two Peoples' home. Situated along the Big Sioux, radiation from the Great War mutated the river's fauna to emit a nearly undetectable substance that can create the appearance of a blood red moon.\n\nThe first Shaman-King grew to lead his people by discovering how to control the emissions of the fauna. By clarifying the divine symbolism of the moon, with a red moon heralding a time of war and a white moon a time of peace, the Shaman-King secured power for him and his successors.\n\nEven now, 200 years later, the only ones entrusted with the secret of the Moon are the current Shaman-King and their chosen successor. This burden rests heavy on Boors Moon. How can he be the only one capable of leading his people?"

  BillyClanton_DESC:0 "A deserter from the Arizona Rangers many decades before the Battle of Kingman, Billy found himself in an odd position when the last splinters of the Arizona Rangers came fleeing south. Over the decades since his desertion, Billy slowly gained power through advocating for isolationism: in the face of the Bull, it seemed like an honest goal. His old sympathies still hung around him, however: how could Clanton turn away the remnants of the Rangers, as broken as they were? After many sleepless nights he reached a compromise with himself, agreeing to let the Rangers settle down in the Cowboy Country if they agreed not to militarise. After all, Clanton couldn't risk Caesar's wrath. Caesar will come for them eventually, but maybe – just maybe – not today."

  ODY_Leader_DESC:0 "In the 2040's the §R“ULYSSES”§! AI research of the company Greenway Hydroponics led to the creation of two artificial intelligences. One, §R"TLALOC"§! would be poised to command Mexico and ensure compliance.\nThe other, §R"ODYSSEUS"§! would be charged with watching and mitigating the spread of the New Plague.\n\nIn the period following the great war ODYSSEUS was tricked by Victor Presper into believing a wide-spread New Plague outbreak had occurred. It would send his robots to rampage across Arizona and Colorado seeking rightful containment of those believed to be carriers, etching fear into the Wasteland as it went. Only a shell remains of its former intelligence remained after a self-inflicted immolation due to falsely believing the New Plague epidemic to be unstoppable.\n\nRecently, Diana Stone has managed to find a backup of ODYSSEUS's memory core, using it and installing it within the memory-drained ZAX of Boulder Dome in order to bring the fabled intelligence online once again."

  ULYSSES_DESC:0 "An experienced warrior and scout, Ulysses is a crafty, resourceful, and dangerously intelligent man, who is capable of surviving even in the most hostile and inhospitable of terrains. The loss of his old home, the Twisted Hairs to Caesar's Legion made Ulysses obsessed with history and symbols. How individuals can impact the former and effectively become the latter, being totally aware of the weight their actions carry.\n\nUlysses has taken to the Divide, travelling through the storms surrounding the Divide to deliver vital packages to the growing settlement, seeing hope that the people there can build something truly great."

When he heard that the Legion was falling apart, he spent every cap he'd ever made to hire mercenaries to bring back with him. He fought desperately to save his family from the shackles of slavery, helping many people in the process. When the dust settled and the Legion was gone, Taklishim wasn't a vagabond any more, he was a leader."

The issues they resolve will have striking effects on the future path of the Republic."

Folks that can help you out, watch your back, and share the load are all you have to rely on sometimes. Bear Bunyan is the kind of man the Timberline relies upon. A strong man yes, but also a compassionate and honest one. A man who knows the forest like the back of his axe and remembers the name of everyone he meets. Without folks like him the Timberline would be lost and they know it, so they celebrate him when given the chance. A meal, a drink, a clap on the back, and then it's back to work for the Bear."

There is a saying that the apple doesn't fall from the tree and the Yorkton family proves that there might be something behind the saying for when you see them in the field it is hard to not see the similarities. Military prowess runs deep in the family, but while the old man looks to the past Eleanor keeps her eyes to the future.

While they are realistic about the nature of the harsh world around them, it is Sea-Bastions finest wish to one day revive those old traditions; protecting the land and the people from each other while nurturing both at the same time. Their words and deeds already begin to sow promising seeds."
